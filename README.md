runcommand/profile
==================

Quickly identify what's slow with WordPress.

`wp profile` monitors key performance indicators of the WordPress execution process to help you quickly identify points of slowness.

Save tens of minutes diagnosing slow WordPress sites with `wp profile`. Because you can easily run it on any server that supports WP-CLI, `wp profile` compliments Xdebug and New Relic by pointing you in the right direction for further debugging. And, because it's a WP-CLI command, using `wp profile` means you don't have to install a plugin and deal with the painful dashboard of a slow WordPress site.

First, run `wp profile` to see metrics for each stage of the WordPress load process:

```
$ wp profile
+------------+---------+------------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| stage      | time    | query_time | query_count | cache_ratio | cache_hits | cache_misses | hook_time | hook_count | request_time | request_count |
+------------+---------+------------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| bootstrap  | 2.0408s | 0.0365s    | 15          | 93.21%      | 412        | 30           | 0.9299s   | 3097       | 0s           | 0             |
| main_query | 0.0123s | 0.0004s    | 3           | 94.29%      | 33         | 2            | 0.0098s   | 79         | 0s           | 0             |
| template   | 0.305s  | 0.0175s    | 179         | 91.02%      | 2636       | 260          | 0.1125s   | 7777       | 0s           | 0             |
+------------+---------+------------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| total      | 2.3582s | 0.0544s    | 197         | 92.84%      | 3081       | 292          | 1.0522s   | 10953      | 0s           | 0             |
+------------+---------+------------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------+--------------+---------------+
```

Then, use `--stage=<stage>` to dive into higher fidelity of a particular stage:

```
$ wp profile --stage=bootstrap

```

Lastly, when you've found a specific hook you'd like to assess, use `--hook=<hook>`:

```
$ wp profile --hook=plugins_loaded
+------------------------------------------------------------+---------+------------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+
| callback                                                   | time    | query_time | query_count | cache_ratio | cache_hits | cache_misses | request_time | request_count |

Et voila! You've identified some of the sources of slowness.
