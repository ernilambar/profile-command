## Overview

`wp profile` monitors key performance indicators of the WordPress execution process to help you quickly identify points of slowness.

Save hours diagnosing slow WordPress sites with `wp profile`. Because you can easily run it on any server that supports WP-CLI, `wp profile` compliments Xdebug and New Relic by pointing you in the right direction for further debugging. And, because it's a WP-CLI command, using `wp profile` means you don't have to install a plugin and deal with the painful dashboard of a slow WordPress site.

First, run `wp profile` to see metrics for each stage of the WordPress load process:

```
$ wp profile
+------------+---------+------------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| stage      | time    | query_time | query_count | cache_ratio | cache_hits | cache_misses | hook_time | hook_count | request_time | request_count |
+------------+---------+------------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| bootstrap  | 2.0408s | 0.0365s    | 15          | 93.21%      | 412        | 30           | 0.9299s   | 3097       | 0s           | 0             |
| main_query | 0.0123s | 0.0004s    | 3           | 94.29%      | 33         | 2            | 0.0098s   | 79         | 0s           | 0             |
| template   | 0.305s  | 0.0175s    | 179         | 91.02%      | 2636       | 260          | 0.1125s   | 7777       | 0s           | 0             |
+------------+---------+------------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| total      | 2.3582s | 0.0544s    | 197         | 92.84%      | 3081       | 292          | 1.0522s   | 10953      | 0s           | 0             |
+------------+---------+------------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------+--------------+---------------+
```

Then, use `--stage=<stage>` to dive into higher fidelity of a particular stage:

```
$ wp profile --stage=bootstrap

```

Lastly, when you've found a specific hook you'd like to assess, use `--hook=<hook>`:

```
$ wp profile --hook=plugins_loaded

Et voila! You've identified some of the sources of slowness.

## Using

This package implements the following commands:

### wp profile stage

Profile each stage of the WordPress load process (bootstrap, main_query, template).

~~~
wp profile stage [<stage>] [--url=<url>] [--fields=<fields>] [--format=<format>]
~~~

**OPTIONS**

	[<stage>]
		Drill down into a specific stage.

	[--url=<url>]
		Execute a request against a specified URL. Defaults to the home URL.

	[--fields=<fields>]
		Display one or more fields.

	[--format=<format>]
		Render output in a particular format.
		---
		default: table
		options:
		  - table
		  - json
		  - yaml
		  - csv
		---



### wp profile hook

Profile key metrics for a WordPress hook (action or filter).

~~~
wp profile hook <hook> [--url=<url>] [--fields=<fields>] [--format=<format>]
~~~

**OPTIONS**

	<hook>
		WordPress hook (action or filter) to profile.

	[--url=<url>]
		Execute a request against a specified URL. Defaults to the home URL.

	[--fields=<fields>]
		Display one or more fields.

	[--format=<format>]
		Render output in a particular format.
		---
		default: table
		options:
		  - table
		  - json
		  - yaml
		  - csv
		---



### wp profile eval

Profile arbitrary code execution.

~~~
wp profile eval <php-code> [--fields=<fields>] [--format=<format>]
~~~

Code execution happens after WordPress has loaded entirely, which means
you can use any utilities defined in WordPress, active plugins, or the
current theme.

**OPTIONS**

	<php-code>
		The code to execute, as a string.

	[--fields=<fields>]
		Display one or more fields.

	[--format=<format>]
		Render output in a particular format.
		---
		default: table
		options:
		  - table
		  - json
		  - yaml
		  - csv
		---



### wp profile eval-file

Profile execution of an arbitrary file.

~~~
wp profile eval-file <file> [--fields=<fields>] [--format=<format>]
~~~

File execution happens after WordPress has loaded entirely, which means
you can use any utilities defined in WordPress, active plugins, or the
current theme.

**OPTIONS**

	<file>
		The path to the PHP file to execute and profile.

	[--fields=<fields>]
		Display one or more fields.

	[--format=<format>]
		Render output in a particular format.
		---
		default: table
		options:
		  - table
		  - json
		  - yaml
		  - csv
		---

## Installing

[Get access to `wp profile` for only $129 per year](https://runcommand.memberful.com/checkout?plan=16079). Purchasing an annual subscription locks you into this price for as long as you stay subscribed. Subscriptions include unlimited downloads of the command, plus support and updates for the length of your subscription.

Once you've purchased a subscription, you can use the `wp profile` command with:

```
wp --require=command.php profile
```

Alternatively, you can [require the command so that it's always available to WP-CLI](https://runcommand.io/to/require-file-wp-cli-yml/) when running as the current system user:

1. Extract the package files to `~/.wp-cli/runcommand-profile`
2. Edit (or create) `~/.wp-cli/config.yml` and include the following require statement:

```
require:
  - runcommand-profile/command.php
```
